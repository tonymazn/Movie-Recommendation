  # By declaring datasetInput as a reactive expression we ensure
  # that:

  # 1. It is only called when the inputs it depends on changes
  # 2. The computation and result are shared by all the callers,
  #    i.e. it only executes a single time

  # Create caption ----
  # The output$caption is computed based on a reactive expression
  # that returns input$caption. When the user changes the
  # "caption" field:
  #
  # 1. This function is automatically called to recompute the output
  # 2. New caption is pushed back to the browser for re-display
  #
  # Note that because the data-oriented reactive expressions
  # below don't depend on input$caption, those expressions are
  # NOT called when input$caption changes
  output$caption <- renderText({
    input$caption
  })
  
  # Generate a summary of the dataset ----
  # The output$summary depends on the datasetInput reactive
  # expression, so will be re-executed whenever datasetInput is
  # invalidated, i.e. whenever the input$dataset changes
  output$summary <- renderPrint({
    dataset <- datasetInput()
    summary(dataset)
  })
  
  # Show the first "n" observations ----
  # The output$view depends on both the databaseInput reactive
  # expression and input$obs, so it will be re-executed whenever
  # input$dataset or input$obs is changed
  output$view <- renderTable({
    head(datasetInput(), n = input$obs)
